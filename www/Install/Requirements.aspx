            You can choose the directory where the Program will be installed. You have to make
            sure that you have the required disk space in that drive. For example, if you change
            the installation directory to d:\Abacasoft, you have to make sure that you have
            at least 5 Mb space on the d drive.

            Distribution size</h3>
        <p>
            The distribution size is less than 2 MB. However the space on disk after installtion
            may vary based on the allocation. It is why we recommend 5 Mb of disk space, just
            to make sure there is enough space on disk.
